[[mod_cdrs_cdrs_module]]
== _CDRs_ module

*Module Identifier: `cdrs`*

*Data owner: `CPO`*

A *Charge Detail Record* is the description of a concluded charging
session. The CDR is the only billing-relevant object.
CDRs are sent from the CPO to the eMSP after the charging session has ended.
There is no requirement to send CDRs semi-realtime, it is seen as good practice to send them
as soon as possible. But if there is an agreement between parties to send them for example once a month, that is also allowed by OCPI.

[[mod_cdrs_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

CDRs are created by the CPO. They probably only will be sent to the eMSP that will be paying the bill of a charging session. Because a CDR is for billing purposes, it cannot be changed/replaced, once sent to the eMSP, changes are not allowed in a CDR.

[[mod_cdrs_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the CPO creates CDR(s) they push them to the relevant eMSP by calling <<mod_cdrs_post_method,POST>> on the eMSPs CDRs endpoint with the newly created CDR(s). A CPO is not required to send ALL CDRs to ALL eMSPs, it is allowed to only send CDRs to the eMSP that a CDR is relevant to.

CDRs should contain enough information (dimensions) to allow the eMSP to validate the total costs.
It is advised to send enough information to the eMSP so it can calculate its own costs for billing their customer. An eMSP might have a very different contract/pricing model with the EV driver than the tariff structure from the CPO.

_NOTE: CDRs can not yet be updated or removed. This might be added in a future version of OCPI._

If the CPO, for any reason wants to view a CDR it has posted to a eMSP system, the CPO can retrieve the CDR by calling the <<mod_cdrs_msp_get_method,GET>> on the eMSPs CDRs endpoint at the URL returned in the response to the <<mod_cdrs_post_method,POST>>.

[[mod_cdrs_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

eMSPs who do not support the push model need to call
<<mod_cdrs_cpo_get_method,GET>> on the CPOs CDRs endpoint to receive a list of CDRs.

This <<mod_cdrs_cpo_get_method,GET>> can also be used, combined with the Push model to retrieve CDRs, after the system (re)connects to a CPO, to get a list of CDRs, 'missed' during a time offline.

A CPO is not required to return all known CDRs, the CPO is allowed to return only the CDRs that are relevant for the requesting eMSP.

[[mod_cdrs_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

There is both a CPO and an eMSP interface for CDRs. Depending on business requirements parties can decide to use
the CPO Interface/Get model, or the eMSP Interface/Push model, or both.
Push is the preferred model to use, the eMSP will receive CDRs when created by the CPO.

[[mod_cdrs_cpo_interface]]

[[mod_cdrs_object_description]]
=== Object description

[[mod_cdrs_cdr_object]]
==== _CDR_ Object

The _CDR_ object describes the Charging Session and its costs, how these costs are built up, etc.

The CDR object is different from the <<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> object. The Session contains a lot of references to other information.
For the Session that works, if information changes during or after a Charging Session, that is not a problem.
For a CDR changing information after a Charging Session has ended, is a problem: What if the address of a <<mod_locations.asciidoc#mod_locations_location_object,Location>> is changed.
The Driver will not recognize that he has charged at that address. <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_token_object,Token>> auth_id might change, this should never impact an existing CDR.

The _CDR_ object shall always contain information like location, EVSE, Tariffs and tokens as they were at the START of the Charging Session.
