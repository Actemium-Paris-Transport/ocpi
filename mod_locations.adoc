:numbered:
== _Locations_ module

*Module Identifier: `locations`*

The Location objects live in the CPO back-end system. They describe the charging locations of that operator.

*Module dependency:* the eMSP endpoint is dependent on the link:mod_tariffs.md#tariffs-module[Tariffs module]

=== Flow and Lifecycle

The Locations module has Locations as base object, Locations have EVSEs, EVSEs have Connectors. With the methods in the link:#22-emsp-interface[eMSP interface], Location information/statuses can be shared with the eMSP. Updates can be done to the Location, but also to only an EVSE or a Connector.

When a CPO creates Location objects it pushes them to the eMSPs by calling link:#222-put-method[PUT] on the eMSPs Locations endpoint. Providers who do not support push mode need to call link:#211-get-method[GET] on the CPOs Locations endpoint to receive the new object.

If the CPO wants to replace a Location related object, they push it to the eMSP systems by calling link:#222-put-method[PUT] on their Locations endpoint.

Any changes to a Location related object can also be pushed to the eMSP by calling the link:#223-patch-method[PATCH] on the eMSPs Locations endpoint. Providers who do not support push mode need to call link:#211-get-method[GET] on the CPOs Locations endpoint to receive the updates.

When the CPO wants to delete an EVSE they must update by setting the `status` field to `REMOVED` and call the link:#222-put-method[PUT] or link:#223-patch-method[PATCH] on the eMSP system. A _Location_ without valid _EVSE_ objects can be considered as expired and should no longer be displayed. There is no direct way to delete a location.

When the CPO is not sure about the state or existence of a Location, EVSE or Connector object in the eMSPs system, the CPO can call the link:#221-get-method[GET] to validate the object in the eMSP system. 

=== Interfaces and endpoints

There is both a CPO and an eMSP interface for Locations. Advised is to use the push direction from CPO to eMSP during normal operation.
The CPO interface is meant to be used when the connection between 2 parties is established, to retrieve the current list of Location objects with the current status, and when the eMSP is not 100% sure the Locations cache is completely correct.
The eMSP can use the CPO GET Object interface to retrieve a specific Location, EVSE or Connector, this might be used by a eMSP that wants information about a specific Location, but has not implemented the eMSP Locations interface (cannot receive push).

==== CPO Interface

Example endpoint structure: `/ocpi/cpo/2.0/locations`

|===

===== *GET* Method

Depending on the URL Segments provided, the GET request can either be used to retrieve
information about a list of available locations and EVSEs at this CPO: link:#get-list-request-parameters[GET List]
Or it can be used to get information about a specific Location, EVSE or Connector: link:#get-object-request-parameters[GET Object]

====== GET List Request Parameters

Example endpoint structures for retrieving a list of Locations:
`/ocpi/cpo/2.0/locations/?date_from=xxx&amp;date_to=yyy`

|&gt; link:#33-connector-object[Connector] |1 |If a Connector object was requested: the Connector object. 
|===


===== eMSP Interface

Locations is a link:transport_and_format.md#client-owned-object-push[client owned object], so the end-points need to contain the required extra fields: {link:credentials.md#credentials-object[party_id]} and {link:credentials.md#credentials-object[country_code]}.
Example endpoint structures:
`/ocpi/emsp/2.0/locations/{country_code}/{party_id}/{location_id}`
`/ocpi/emsp/2.0/locations/{country_code}/{party_id}/{location_id}/{evse_uid}`
`/ocpi/emsp/2.0/locations/{country_code}/{party_id}/{location_id}/{evse_uid}/{connector_id}`

|===
|Method |Description 

|link:#221-get-method[GET] |Retrieve a Location as it is stored in the eMSP system. 
|POST |n/a _(use link:#222-put-method[PUT])_ 
|link:#222-put-method[PUT] |Push new/updated Location, EVSE and/or Connectors to the eMSP 
|link:#223-patch-method[PATCH] |Notify the eMSP of partial updates to a Location, EVSEs or Connector (such as the status). 
|DELETE |n/a _(use link:#223-patch-method[PATCH])_ 
|===

===== *GET* Method

If the CPO wants to check the status of a Location, EVSE or Connector object in the eMSP system, it might GET the object from the eMSP system for validation purposes. The CPO is the owner of the objects, so it would be illogical if the eMSP system had a different status or was missing an object. If a discrepancy is found, the CPO might push an update to the eMSP via a link:#222-put-method[PUT] or link:#223-patch-method[PATCH] call.

=== Object description

Location, EVSE and Connector have the following relation.

image:data/locations-class-diagram.png[Location class diagram]

==== _Location_ Object

The _Location_ object describes the location and its properties where a group of EVSEs that belong together are installed. Typically the _Location_ object is the exact location of the group of EVSEs, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage which contains these EVSEs. The exact way to reach each EVSE can be further specified by its own properties.

==== _EVSE_ Object

The _EVSE_ object describes the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. It always belongs to a _Location_ object. It will only contain directions to get from the location to the EVSE (i.e. _floor_, _physical_reference_ or _directions_). When these properties are insufficient to reach the EVSE from the _Location_ point, then it typically indicates that this EVSE should be put in a different _Location_ object (sometimes with the same address but with different coordinates/directions).

An _EVSE_ object has a list of connectors which can not be used simultaneously: only one connector per EVSE can be used at the time.
