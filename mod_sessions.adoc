:numbered:
== _Sessions_ module

*Module Identifier: `sessions`*

The Session object describes one charging session.
The Session object is owned by the CPO back-end system, and can be GET from the CPO system, or pushed by the CPO to another system.

=== Flow and Lifecycle

==== Push model

When the CPO creates a Session object they push it to the eMSPs by calling link:#222-put-method[PUT] on the eMSPs Sessions endpoint with the newly created Session object.

Any changes to a Session in the CPO system are sent to the eMSP system by calling link:#223-patch-method[PATCH] on the eMSPs Sessions endpoint with the updated Session object.

Sessions cannot be deleted, final status of a session is: `COMPLETED`.

When the CPO is not sure about the state or existence of a Session object in the eMSPs system, the CPO can call the link:#221-get-method[GET] to validate the Session object in the eMSP system. 

==== Pull model

eMSPs who do not support the push model need to call link:#211-get-method[GET] on the CPOs Sessions endpoint to receive a list of Sessions.

This link:#211-get-method[GET] can also be used, combined with the Push model to retrieve Sessions after the system (re)connects to a CPO, to get a list Sessions 'missed' during a time offline.

=== Interfaces and endpoints

==== CPO Interface

Example endpoint structure: `/ocpi/cpo/2.0/sessions/?date_from=xxx&amp;date_to=yyy`

|===
|Method |Description

|POST |n/a 
|PUT |n/a 
|PATCH |n/a 
|DELETE |n/a 
|===

===== *GET* Method

====== Response Data

The response contains a list of Session objects that match the given parameters in the request, the header will contain the link:transport_and_format.md#paginated-response[pagination] related headers. 

Any older information that is not specified in the response is considered as no longer valid.
Each object must contain all required fields. Fields that are not specified may be considered as null values.

|===
|Datatype |Card. |Description 

|link:#31-session-object[Session] |* |List of Session objects that match the request parameters 
|===

===== eMSP Interface

Sessions is a link:transport_and_format.md#client-owned-object-push[client owned object], so the end-points need to contain the required extra fields: {link:credentials.md#credentials-object[party_id]} and {link:credentials.md#credentials-object[country_code]}.
Example endpoint structure:
`/ocpi/emsp/2.0/sessions/{country_code}/{party_id}/{session_id}` 

|===
|Method |Description 

|link:#221-get-method[GET] |Get the Session object from the eMSP system by its id {session_id}. 
|POST |n/a 
|link:#222-put-method[PUT] |Send a new/updated Session object 
|link:#223-patch-method[PATCH] |Update the Session object of id {session_id}. 
|DELETE |n/a 
|===

===== *GET* Method

The CPO system might request the current version of a Session object from the eMSP system for,
for example validation purposes, or the CPO system might have received a error on a PATCH.

|===
|Parameter |Datatype |Required |Description

|Property |Description 

|ACTIVE |The session is accepted and active. Al pre-condition are met: Communication between EV and EVSE (for example: cable plugged in correctly), EV or Driver is authorized. EV is being charged, or can be charged. Energy is, or is not, being transfered. 
|COMPLETED |The session is finished successfully. No more modifications will be made to this session. 
|INVALID |The session is declared invalid and will not be billed.
