== _Tariffs_ module


*Module Identifier: `tariffs`*

The Tariffs module gives eMSPs information about the tariffs used by the CPO.

[[mod_tariffs_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

[[mod_tariffs_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the CPO creates a new Tariff they push them to the eMSPs by calling the <<mod_tariffs_put_method,PUT>> on the eMSPs
Tariffs endpoint with the newly created Tariff object.

Any changes to the Tariff(s) in the CPO system can be send to the eMSP system by calling either <<mod_tariffs_put_method,PUT>>
or <<mod_tariffs_patch_method,PATCH>> on the eMSPs Tariffs endpoint with the updated Tariff object.

When the CPO deletes a Tariff, they will update the eMSPs systems by calling <<mod_tariffs_delete_method,DELETE>>
on the eMSPs Tariffs endpoint, with the ID of the Tariff that is deleted.

When the CPO is not sure about the state or existence of a Tariff object in the eMSPs system, the
CPO can call the <<mod_tariffs_msp_get_method,GET>> to validate the Tariff object in the eMSP system. 

[[mod_tariffs_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

eMSPs who do not support the push model need to call
<<mod_tariffs_cpo_get_method,GET>> on the CPOs Tariff endpoint to receive
all Tariffs, replacing the current list of known Tariffs with the newly received list.

[[mod_tariffs_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

There is both a CPO and an eMSP interface for Tariffs. Advised is to use the push direction from CPO to eMSP during normal operation.
The CPO interface is meant to be used when the connection between 2 parties is established to retrieve the current list of Tariffs objects, and when the eMSP is not 100% sure the Tariff cache is still correct.

[[mod_tariffs_cpo_interface]]
==== CPO Interface

The CPO Tariffs interface gives the eMSP the ability to request tariffs.

Example endpoint structure: `/ocpi/cpo/2.0/tariffs/?date_from=xxx&amp;date_to=yyy`

[cols="2,12",options="header"]
|===
|Method |Description 

|<<mod_tariffs_cpo_get_method,GET>> |Returns Tariff Objects from the CPO, last updated between the {date_from} and {date_to} (<<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_pagination,paginated>>) 
|POST |n/a 
|PUT |n/a 
|PATCH |n/a

|===

[[mod_tariffs_cpo_get_method]]
===== *GET* Method

Fetch information about all Tariffs.

[[mod_tariffs_cpo_get_request_parameters]]
====== Request Parameters

If additional parameters: {date_from} and/or {date_to} are provided, only Tariffs with (`last_updated`) between the given date_from and date_to will be returned.

This request is <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_pagination,paginated>>, it supports the <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_paginated_request,pagination>> related URL parameters.

[cols="3,2,1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Datatype |Required |Description 

|date_from |<<types.asciidoc#types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |no |Only return Tariffs that have `last_updated` after this Date/Time. 
|date_to |<<types.asciidoc#types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |no |Only return Tariffs that have `last_updated` before this Date/Time. 
|offset |int |no |The offset of the first object returned. Default is 0. 
|limit |int |no |Maximum number of objects to GET. 
|===

[[mod_tariffs_cpo_get_response_data]]
====== Response Data

The endpoint returns an object with a list of valid Tariffs, the header will contain the <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_paginated_response,pagination>> related headers.

Any older information that is not specified in the response is considered as no longer valid.
Each object must contain all required fields. Fields that are not specified may be considered as null values.

[cols="4,1,12",options="header"]
|===
|Type |Card. |Description 

|<<mod_tariffs_tariff_object,Tariff>> |* |List of all tariffs. 
|===

[[mod_tariffs_emsp_interface]]
==== eMSP Interface

Tariffs is a <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,client owned object>>, so the end-points need to contain the required extra fields: {<<credentials.asciidoc#credentials_credentials_object,party_id>>} and {<<credentials.asciidoc#credentials_credentials_object,country_code>>}.
Example endpoint structure:
`/ocpi/emsp/2.0/tariffs/{country_code}/{party_id}/{tariff_id}`

[cols="2,12",options="header"]
|===
|Method |Description 

|<<mod_tariffs_msp_get_method,GET>> |Retrieve a Tariff as it is stored in the eMSP system. 
|POST |n/a 
|<<mod_tariffs_put_method,PUT>> |Push new/updated Tariff object to the eMSP. 
|<<mod_tariffs_patch_method,PATCH>> |Notify the eMSP of partial updates to a Tariff. 
|<<mod_tariffs_delete_method,DELETE>> |Remove Tariff object which is no longer valid 
|===

[[mod_tariffs_msp_get_method]]
===== *GET* Method

If the CPO wants to check the status of a Tariff in the eMSP system it might GET the object from the eMSP system for validation purposes. The CPO is the owner of the objects, so it would be illogical if the eMSP system had a different status or was missing an object.

[[mod_tariffs_object_description]]
=== Object description

[[mod_tariffs_tariff_object]]
==== _Tariff_ Object

A Tariff Object consists of a list of one or more TariffElements, these elements can be used to create complex Tariff structures.
When the list of _elements_ contains more then 1 element, than the first tariff in the list with matching restrictions will be used.

It is advised to always set a "default" tariff, the last tariff in the list of _elements_ with no restriction. This acts as a fallback when
non of the TariffElements before this matches the current charging period.

To define a "Free of Charge" Tariff in OCPI, a tariff has to be provided that has a `type` = `FLAT` and `price` = `0.00`.
See: <<mod_tariffs_free_of_charge_tariff_example,Free of Charge Tariff example>>

[cols="3,2,1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Type |Card. |Description 

|id |<<types.asciidoc#types_string_type,string>>(36) |1 |Uniquely identifies the tariff within the CPOs platform (and suboperator platforms). 
|currency |<<types.asciidoc#types_string_type,string>>(3) |1 |Currency of this tariff, ISO 4217 Code 
|type |<<mod_tariffs_tariff_type,TariffType>> |? | Defines what type of tariff this is. This makes it possible to make distinction possible for different <<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_set_charging_preferences,Charging Preferences>>. When omitted, this tariff is valid for all sessions.
|tariff_alt_text |<<types.asciidoc#types_displaytext_class,DisplayText>> |* |List of multi language alternative tariff info text
|tariff_alt_url |<<types.asciidoc#types_url_type,URL>> |? |Alternative URL to tariff info 
|min_price |<<types.asciidoc#types_price_class,Price>> |? |When this field is set, a Charging Session with this tariff will minimum cost this amount.
      This is different from a "Start Tariff, Transaction Fee, Start Fee, Session Fee etc.", such a fee is a fixed amount that has to be payed for any Charging Session.
      A Minimum price means that when the cost of a Charging Session is lower then this amount, the cost of the Session will be equal to this amount. Also see note below.
|max_price |<<types.asciidoc#types_price_class,Price>> |? |When this field is set, a Charging Session with this tariff will NOT cost more then this amount. See note below.
|elements |<<mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class,TariffElement>> |+ |List of tariff elements
|start_datetime |<<types.asciidoc#types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |? |The time when this tariff becomes active. Typically used for a new tariff that is already given with the location, before it becomes active. (See note below)
|end_datetime |<<types.asciidoc#types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |? |The time after which this tariff is no longer valid. Typically used when this tariff is going to be replaced with a different tariff in the near future. (See note below)
|energy_mix |<<mod_locations.asciidoc#mod_locations_energymix_class,EnergyMix>> |? |Details on the energy supplied with this tariff.
|last_updated |<<types.asciidoc#types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |1 |Timestamp when this Tariff was last updated (or created). 
|===

NOTE: `min_price`: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where minimum including VAT is reached earlier or later then then the minimum excluding VAT.
So as a rule: they both apply:
 - Minimum cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be lower than the min_price including VAT.
 - Minimum cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be lower than the min_price excluding VAT.

NOTE: `max_price`: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where maximum including VAT is reached earlier or later then then the maximum excluding VAT.
So as a rule: they both apply:
 - Total cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be higher than the max_price including VAT.
 - Total cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be higher than the max_price excluding VAT.

NOTE: `start_datetime` and `end_datetime`: When the tariff of a Charge Point (Location) is changed with an ongoing charging session,
it is common to not switch the tariff until the ongoing session is finished. But this is NOT a rule of OCPI.
The driver has started charging and might have read the tariff info before charging. When the tariff is then changed during the session,
the driver might get a bill that is higher then expected.

For ad-hoc charging (paying for charging without a contract, the tariff `elements` are less needed.
Normally no CDR will be send to an MSP for ad-hoc charging.

For this example, credit card start tariff is 0.50 euro, but when using a debit card it is only 0.25 euro.

Such a tariff cannot be modeled with OCPI, but by modeling it as 0.50 euro start tariff,
using a debit card as a discount of 0.25 euro. Nobody is likely to complain. But the `tariff_alt_text` explains this clearly.

In such case, the price might not be fixed, but depend on the real-time energy prices.
To explain this to the driver, a short text inside `tariff_alt_text` might not be the best solution, maybe you want to show a graph.
In such a case, an URL can be given that links to a better explanation of the tariff.

- 0.25 euro per kWh (excluding VAT)

|===

The `step_size` also depends on the `type`, every `type` (except `FLAT`) defines a step_size multiplier, this is the size of every 'step' for that type in the gaven unit.
For example: `PARKING_TIME` has 'step_size multiplier: 1 second' That means that the `step_size` of a `PriceComponent` is multiplied by 1 second.
Thus a `step_size = 300` means 300 seconds.
