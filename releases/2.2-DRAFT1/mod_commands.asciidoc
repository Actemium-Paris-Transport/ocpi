== _Commands_ module

*Module Identifier: `commands`*

The Commands module enables remote commands to be sent to a Location/EVSE.
The following commands are supported:

- `RESERVE_NOW`
- `CANCEL_RESERVATION`
- `START_SESSION`
- `STOP_SESSION`
- `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR`

See <<mod_commands_commandtype_enum,CommandType>> for a description of the different commands.
_Use the `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` command with care, please read the note at <<mod_commands_commandtype_enum,CommandType>>._ 

*Module dependency:* <<mod_locations.asciidoc#mod_locations_locations_module,Locations module>>, <<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_sessions_module,Sessions module>>

[[mod_commands_flow]]
=== Flow

With the Commands module, commands can be sent from the eMSP, via the CPO to a Charge Point.
Most Charge Point are hooked up to the internet via a relative slow wireless connection. To prevent long blocking calls,
the commands module is designed to work asynchronously.

The eMSP send a request to a CPO, via the CPO Commands interface.
The CPO checks if it can send the request to a Charge Point and will respond to the request with a status, indicating if the request can be sent to a Charge Point.

The CPO sends the requested command (via another protocol, for example: OCPP) to a Charge Point.
The Charge Point will respond if it understands the command and will try to execute the command.
This response doesn't always mean that the command was executed successfully.
The CPO will forward the result in a new POST request to the eMSP Commands interface.

The following examples try to give insight into the message flow and the asynchronous nature of the OCPI Commands.
Example of a `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` that fails because the Location is not known by the CPO.

.UNLOCK_CONNECTOR Unknown Location

Example of a `RESERVE_NOW` that is rejected by the Charge Point.

.RESERVE_NEW rejected by Charge Point
image::images/command_reservenow_rejected.svg[RESERVE_NEW rejected by Charge Point]


Example of a `START_SESSION` that is accepted, but no new Session is started because EV not plugged in before end of time-out.
This is an example for Charge Point that allows a remote start when the cable is not yet plugged in.
Some Charge Points even require this, there might, for example, be a latch in front of the socket to prevent vandalism.

.START_SESSION failed
image::images/command_start_session_timeout.svg[START_SESSION failed]


Example of a `START_SESSION` that is accepted, but no new Session is started because the EV is not plugged in,
and this Charge Point does not allow a remote start without a cable already being plugged in.

.START_SESSION failed
image::images/command_start_session_no_cable.svg[START_SESSION failed]


Example of a `START_SESSION` that is accepted and results in a new Session.

.START_SESSION successful
image::images/command_start_session_succesful.svg[START_SESSION successful]

_These examples use OCPP 1.6 based commands between CPO and Charge Point, but that is not a requirement for OCPI._

[[mod_commands_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

The commands module consists of two interfaces: a CPO interface that enables a eMSP (and its clients) to send commands to a Charge Point and an eMSP interface to receive the response from the Charge Point asynchronously.

[[mod_commands_cpo_interface]]
==== CPO Interface

Example endpoint structure: `/ocpi/cpo/2.0/commands/{command}`

[cols="2,12",options="header"]
|===
|Method |Description 

|GET |n/a 
|<<mod_commands_cpo_post_method,POST>> |Send a command to the CPO, requesting the CPO to send the command to the Charge Point 
|PUT |n/a 
|PATCH |n/a 
|DELETE |n/a 
|===


[[mod_commands_cpo_post_method]]
===== *POST* Method

[[mod_commands_msp_post_request_parameters]]
====== Request Parameters

The following parameters can be provided as URL segments.

[cols="3,2,1,10",options="header"]

|Parameter |Datatype |Required |Description 

|command |<<mod_commands_commandtype_enum,CommandType>> |yes |Type of command that is requested. 
|===

[[mod_commands_cpo_post_request_body]]
===== Request Body

Depending on the `command` parameter the body SHALL contain the applicable object for that command. 

[cols="4,1,12",options="header"]
|===
|Type |Card. |Description

|_Choice: one of five_ | |
|&gt; <<mod_commands_cancelreservation_object,CancelReservation>> |1 |CancelReservation object, for the `CANCEL_RESERVATION` command, with information needed to cancel an existing reservation.
|&gt; <<mod_commands_reservenow_object,ReserveNow>> |1 |ReserveNow object, for the `RESERVE_NOW` command, with information needed to reserve a (specific) connector of a Charge Point for a given Token.
|&gt; <<mod_commands_startsession_object,StartSession>> |1 |StartSession object, for the `START_SESSION` command, with information needed to start a sessions.
|&gt; <<mod_commands_stopsession_object,StopSession>> |1 |StopSession object, for the `STOP_SESSION` command, with information needed to stop a sessions. 
|&gt; <<mod_commands_unlockconnector_object,UnlockConnector>> |1 |UnlockConnector object, for the `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` command, with information needed to unlock a connector of a Charge Point. 
|===

[[mod_commands_response_data]]
====== Response Data

The response contains the direct response from the CPO, not the response from the Charge Point itself, that will be sent via an asynchronous POST on the eMSP interface if this response is `ACCEPTED`.

[cols="4,1,12",options="header"]
|===
|Datatype |Card. |Description 

|<<mod_commands_commandresponse_object,CommandResponse>> |1 |Result of the command request, by the CPO (not the Charge Point). So this indicates if the CPO understood the command request and was able to send it to the Charge Point. This is not the response by the Charge Point 
|===

[[mod_commands_emsp_interface]]
==== eMSP Interface

The eMSP interface receives the asynchronous responses.

Example endpoint structure:
`/ocpi/emsp/2.0/commands/{command}`
`/ocpi/emsp/2.0/commands/{command}/{uid}`

[cols="2,12",options="header"]
|===
|Method |Description 

|GET |n/a 
|<<mod_commands_msp_post_method,POST>> |Receive the asynchronous response from the Charge Point. 
|PUT |n/a 
|PATCH |n/a 
|DELETE |n/a 
|===


[[mod_commands_msp_post_method]]
===== *POST* Method

[[mod_commands_cpo_post_request_parameters]]
====== Request Parameters

There are no URL segment parameters required by OCPI.
It is up to the implementation of the eMSP to determine what parameters are put in the URL. The eMSP sends a URL in the POST method body to the CPO. The CPO is required to use this URL for the asynchronous response by the Charge Point. It is advised to make this URL unique for every request to differentiate simultaneous commands, for example by adding a unique id as a URL segment.

Example:
`/ocpi/emsp/2.0/commands/RESERVE_NOW/1234`
`/ocpi/emsp/2.0/commands/UNLOCK_CONNECTOR/2`

[[mod_commands_msp_post_request_body]]

|===
|Property |Type |Card. |Description

|===


[[mod_commands_commandresponse_object]]
==== _CommandResponse_ Object

The CommandResponse object is send in the HTTP response body.

Because OCPI does not allow/require retries, it could happen that the asynchronous result url given by the eMSP is never successfully called.
The eMSP might have had a glitch, HTTP 500 returned, was offline for a moment etc.
For the eMSP to be able to give a quick as possible response to another system or driver app. it is important for the eMSP to known the timeout on a certain command.

==== CommandType _enum_

The command requested.
[cols="3,10",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description 

|CANCEL_RESERVATION |Request the Charge Point to cancel a specific reservation.
|RESERVE_NOW |Request the Charge Point to reserve a (specific) EVSE for a Token for a certain time, starting now.
|START_SESSION |Request the Charge Point to start a transaction on the given EVSE/Connector. 
|STOP_SESSION |Request the Charge Point to stop an ongoing session. 
|UNLOCK_CONNECTOR |Request the Charge Point to unlock the connector (if applicable). This functionality is for help desk operators only! 
|===

*The command `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` may only be used by an operator or the eMSP. This command SHALL never be allowed to be sent directly by the EV-Driver.
The `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` is intended to be used in the rare situation that the connector is not unlocked successfully after a transaction is stopped. The mechanical unlock of the lock mechanism might get stuck, for example: fail when there is tension on the charging cable when the Charge Point tries to unlock the connector.
In such a situation the EV-Driver can call either the CPO or the eMSP to retry the unlocking.*
