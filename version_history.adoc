*Document revisions*
There can be multiple documentation revisions of the same version of the OCPI protocol.
The newer revisions of the same protocol version can never change the content of the messages: no new fields or renaming of fields. A new revision can only clarify/fix texts/descriptions and fix typos etc.

These revisions (not the first) will be named: d2, d3, d4 etc.
